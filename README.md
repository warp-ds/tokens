# Tokens

This repo imports colour variables/tokens from Figma using Figma's API, and uses Style Dictionary to transform those tokens to CSS, Android and iOS.

## How to use

First time do a pnpm install to make sure all packages are installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

And then run the whole script:
```sh
pnpm build
```

Note: Never commit your FIGMA Token. Also make sure your FIGMA Token has access to the project
